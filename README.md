## 🧠 What is Euro?

**Euro** is a modern, full-stack social network platform for thoughtful people who appreciate:

- 🧭 clear UX over noisy feeds
- 💬 meaningful interactions over mindless scrolls
- 🛠️ robust architecture over spaghetti code
- 🎩 and just a touch of elegance in every pixel

It’s not a clone. It’s a **clean room rethink** – designed to feel fresh, calm, and unapologetically confident.

## 🔧 Tech Stack (a.k.a. What’s Under the Hood)

- **Node.js** + **Express** + **TypeScript** — simple yet gracefully designed, like the streets of Copenhagen
- **Dependency Injection** architecture (`@injectable()` all the way) — clean and refreshing, like alpine water 🚰
- **MongoDB** — flexible and pragmatic like Swedish workday
- **Clean Layering:** `Model → Repository → Service → Use Case → Controller` — strictly structured, like Europort in Rotterdam

## 🏛️ Architecture Philosophy

> “Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.” – Einstein.

This project follows **clear separation of concerns**, scalable modules, and a _“don’t surprise your future self”_ coding style.  
Every layer has its place – and no, business logic is not welcome in your controller, thank you very much.
